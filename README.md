ToPyString is a .NET System.Collections extension for converting collections to a string in Python format.

The reason this small project exists is because it's a shame that C# doesn't have an in-built way of stringifying collections (like many other languages do). Although creating a `ToString` method for your collections isn't difficult, you shouldn't be wasting time implementing rudimentary things on every project... especially on projects you're using to just quickly try something out and Console.WriteLine the output.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to see how simple it is to use `ToPyString`.

### Prerequisites

This package supports every .NET version from the .NET Standard 2.0 and up!

You can find the .NET download page [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

### Installing

You can get `ToPyString` by installing the [Collections.Extensions.ToPyString](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Collections.Extensions.ToPyString) NuGet package:

```powershell
Install-Package Collections.Extensions.ToPyString
```

Or via the NET command line interface:

```bash
dotnet add package Collections.Extensions.ToPyString
```

## Using ToPyString

`ToPyString` is an extension method that can be used on all .NET types.

- List:

```csharp
var list = new List<object> { 11, "john", "doe" };

Console.WriteLine(list.ToPyString()); // Output: [11, 'john', 'doe']
```

 -Self-containing List:

```csharp
var list = new List<object> { 11 };
list.Add(list);

Console.WriteLine(list.ToPyString()); // Output: [11, [...]]
```

- Dictionary:

```csharp
var dictionary = new Dictionary<object, object> { [1] = "key1", ["key2"] = 2, [new object()] = null };

Console.WriteLine(dictionary.ToPyString()); // Output: {1: 'key1', 'key2': 2, System.Object: null}
```

- Self-containing Dictionary:

```csharp
var dictionary = new Dictionary<object, object> { [1] = "key1" };
dictionary.Add("self", dictionary);

Console.WriteLine(dictionary.ToPyString()); // Output: {1: 'key1', 'self': {...}}
```

- String and primitive types:

```csharp
var str = "some string";
var intNum = 11;
var doubleNum = 1.012d;

Console.WriteLine(str.ToPyString()); // Output: some string
Console.WriteLine(intNum.ToPyString()); // Output: 11
Console.WriteLine(doubleNum.ToPyString()); // Output: 1.012
```

### Be careful when using ToPyString with `dynamic` type

Because of the way _dynamic_ type is implemented the CLR will throw a `RuntimeBinderException` if you try to call the `ToPyString` extension method directly on a `dynamic` object. To get around this issue simply use `ToPyString` as a regular static method.

**Wrong use with `dynamic`:**

```csharp
dynamic dynObject = new { SomeField = 1 };

Console.WriteLine(dynObject.ToPyString()); // --> will throw a RuntimeBinderException
```

**Correct use:**

```csharp
dynamic dynObject = new { SomeField = 1 };

Console.WriteLine(CollectionExtensions.ToPyString(dynObject)); // Output: { SomeField = 1 }
```

If you have a collection that contains a `dynamic` object, you can use the `ToPyString` as usual:

```csharp
dynamic dynObject = new { SomeField = 1 };
var list = new List<object> { dynObject };

Console.WriteLine(list.ToPyString()); // Output: [{ SomeField = 1 }]
```

## Running the tests

To run the tests using the command line use:

```bash
dotnet test
```

Alternatively, if you're using Visual Studio, you have a button that runs the tests for you, so you can also use that.

### Break down of unit tests

The tests are mainly testing whether C# Collections types are converted to string in the expected Python format, and confirming that calling `ToPyString` on non-collections 
behaves the same way that calling `ToString` would.

```csharp
[Fact]
public void Prints_List_Of_Ints()
{
    var list = new List<int> { 1, 2, -3, 100 };
    var expectedResult = "[1, 2, -3, 100]";

    var result = list.ToPyString();

    Assert.Equal(expectedResult, result);
}
```

## Final thoughts

If you found this extension helpfull then please give it a star ðŸŒŸ and share it with others, help them so they also NOT waste time on stringifying collections.

Finally, if you have any suggestions on refactoring the codebase to make it simpler, more extensible, more elegant - please let me know, I LOVE refactoring!
